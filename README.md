# Sample Spring Boot + Kafka + Docker Compose Project

This is a sample Spring Boot project demonstrating how to run a local **Kafka** and **Zookeeper** setup using **Docker Compose**, and how to integrate Kafka consumers and Kafka Streams in a simple, working Spring Boot application.

It accompanies a blog post that explains the setup step by step and shows how Kafka partitioning and stream processing work in practice.



> ðŸ›‘ Not intended for production use â€” this is a minimal setup for learning.
